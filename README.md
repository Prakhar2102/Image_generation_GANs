# Image_generation_using_semantic_manipulation_GAN
Currently leading a project utilizing deep learning and generative adversarial networks to produce diverse and lifelike images through semantic manipulation with my team members Dhruv Srivastava & Shubham.
Research in the area that aims to produce visually realistic images by controlling their semantic content. To generate diverse, realistic, and controllable images.
To advance the understanding of deep learning models and their representations of visual content.
To have the potential in various domains, including art, design, computer graphics, and data augmentation.
